# Password Generator Challenge

## Description 
This is a password generator, I was given the starting code with HTML and CSS completed for me. The challenge was to create prompts and functions in javascript that would allow the user to create a password within the given parameters. This was no easy challenge as I used many resources. I got most of my help from a tutor and a book on javascript I purchased not too long ago. This password generator could be used and is functioning after many hours of testing out functions and prompts.
